# myShelf

as someone who enjoys not only reading but having a good conversation about it, I created myShelf as some kind of bulletin board, where people can explore thoughts and quotes around their favourite books.

## features
* create new book
* search after book/author
* create comment after category "inside the book"
* filter categories
* rate existing posts
